Goblock
=======
A visual programming for newbies. Goblock is built on top of google blockly. Compared to the original google blockly, it has several advantages:

* No ugly alert and prompt
  Goblock use stratified.js and alertify to completely replace alert and prompt. Thus, you will not have a problem by accidentally check Prevent this page from creating another dialog.

* Console-like output
  Rather than using javascript alert, goblock prints the output into console-like interface, thus you can retrieve the output history easier. I also have modify it can print array beautifuly.

* Better toolbox arrangement
  The toolbox is arranged in a more practical order, so that you won't have any difficulty to find where-is-what.

* Python and Javascript
  You can immediately look for corresponding python & javascript code in the same screen.
