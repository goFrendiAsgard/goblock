  @desc      
             This module tracks the [marked library](https://github.com/chjj/marked) by Christopher Jeffrey.

             It implements a high-speed markdown to html converter, supporting the full set
             of [markdown features](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) 
             as well as some of the 
             [GFM](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/) 
             enhancements.

/**
   @function convert
   @param {String} [text] Markdown text to convert
   @param {optional Object} [settings] Hash of settings
   @summary Convert Markdown text to HTML
   @setting {Boolean} [gfm=true] Enable [github flavored markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown).
   @setting {Function} [highlight] A callback to highlight code blocks (see below).
   @setting {Boolean} [breaks=false] Enable GFM line breaks.
   @setting {Boolean} [tables=true] Enable GFM tables. Requires `gfm:true`.
   @setting {Boolean} [pedantic=false] Conform to obscure parts of markdown.pl as much as possible. Don't fix any of the original markdown bugs or poor behavior.
   @setting {Boolean} [sanitize=false] Sanitize the output. Ignore any HTML that has been input.
   @setting {Boolean} [smartLists=true] Use smarter list behavior than the original markdown. May eventually be default with the old behavior moved into `pedantic`.
   @setting {Boolean} [smartypants=false] Use "smart" typographic punctuation for things like quotes and dashes.
   @setting {String}  [langPrefix='lang-'] Set the prefix for code block classes.
   @setting {Boolean} [escapeCode=true] Whether to escape ampersands in code blocks. (Oni Labs enhancement; the normal marked behaviour is to escape)
   @desc
     If code-highlighting is desired, pass in a `highlight` function with 
     signature `function highlight(code, lang)`. 
     The function must be **non-blocking**, i.e. not use any asynchronous constructs, 
     like `require()` or `hold()` calls, and return the marked up code as a string.

     `lang` will be the language identifier, as specified by GFM, or `undefined` if not
     given. `code` is the code to mark up.
