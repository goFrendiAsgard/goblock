Numeric Javascript by Sébastien Loisel
======================================

Numeric Javascript is a javascript library for doing numerical
analysis in the browser. Because Numeric Javascript uses only the
javascript programming language, it works in many browsers and does
not require powerful servers.

Numeric Javascript is for building "web 2.0" apps that can perform
complex calculations in the browser and thus avoid the latency of
asking a server to compute something. Indeed, you do not need a
powerful server (or any server at all) since your web app will perform
all its calculations in the client.
