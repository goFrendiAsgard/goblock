/**
  @module    moment-timezone
  @summary   Timezone support for sjs:moment
  @home      sjs:moment-timezone
  @desc      
             This module tracks the [momentjs/timezone](https://github.com/moment/moment-timezone/) library (version: 0.5.3) with all current (2016c) IANA timezone data built-in.

             ### Usage

             sjs:moment-timezone `require`s the sjs:moment module, amends it with 
             timezone functionality and returns it as its module.export.

             There are no exported symbols from this module. The return value of `require('sjs:moment')` is itself a function, as documented at http://momentjs.com.

/**
  turn off docs from this point onwards:

*/

var moment = require('./moment');

__js {

/* coerce into using sjs's require mechanism:
*/

function define(deps, factory) {
  module.exports = factory(moment);
}
define.amd = true;
