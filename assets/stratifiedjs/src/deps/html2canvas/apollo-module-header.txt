/**
  @module    html2canvas
  @summary   Generate virtual screenshots of HTML elements (tracking the [html2canvas library](http://html2canvas.hertzen.com/))
  @hostenv   xbrowser

  @function render
  @param {DOMElement} [element]
  @param {Settings} [opts]
  @summary Render `element` to a HTML `<canvas>` reresentation.
  @return {DOMElement} A <canvas> element.
  @desc
    Since there is no browser API for actually capturing screenshots, this library
    makes a best-effort attempt to emulate a browser rendering based on the current
    state of the DOM. The resulting screenshots are therefore not 100% percent accurate,
    and may not include some cross-origin content due to browser security policies (e.g images, iframes).

    See the [official webpage](http://html2canvas.hertzen.com/) for further details.
