  @module    moment
  @summary   Parsing, validating, manipulating and displaying dates

  @desc      
             This module tracks the [momentjs](https://github.com/moment/moment/) library (version 2.13.0 without locale bundles).

             ### Usage

             There are no exported symbols from this module. The return value of `require('sjs:moment')` is itself a function, as documented at http://momentjs.com.

             If you need timezone support, you should use [./moment-timezone::] instead.
             Requireing the latter also amends any previously loaded 'moment' module with
             timezone functionality.
