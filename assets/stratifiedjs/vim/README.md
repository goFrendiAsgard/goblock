# Vim syntax support for [stratified javascript][sjs]

Based on the builtin Javascript syntax support, with syntax
highlighting for all additional SJS syntax.

To use with [pathogen][], copy the `stratifiedjs` folder into
`~/.vim/bundle`. If you don't use [pathogen][] (or something
similar), now's a good time to start - but you can always
install manually if you're stubborn.
