    Everyone has someone or something he/she loves. Rabbit loves carrot, Panda loves bamboo, 
    My friend loves steak, and I love you.
</p>
<p>
    Do you see the pattern? All statements I write has <b>X love Y</b> pattern.
    X and Y could be rabbit, panda, steak, you, or everything. 
    Since the values of X and Y are not fixed, they are called variable.
    In the current block, there is a variable named <b>question</b> run the block to see how variable works.

    Your second task is to teach Guo about love. Make Guo ask for <b>X</b> and <b>Y</b>, and say <b>X love Y</b> confidently.
    Remember, you can always use prompt block.
