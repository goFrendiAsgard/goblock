    On 2005, ESA has launch a robot to a commet, and it just arrive recently.
    To send the robot, we need a rocket.

    Guo and his friends of pandaria watched this event cheerfully.
    Before the rocket launched, Guo and friends count 5,4,3,2,1 and launch....

    But hey, sometime the rocket launcher counter not started from 5.
    Let's help Guo to make a rocket launcher program.
    The input and output sample is as follow (<b>Hint:</b> you need at least 2 variables and repeat-while block):

<p><b>Input : </b><br />3</p>
<p><b>Output : </b><br />3<br />2<br />1<br />Launch</p>
