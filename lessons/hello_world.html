    Hi and welcome to the first lesson.
</p>
<p>
    In your left-side pane, there is a panel named <b>Block Workspace</b>.
    You can add and arange as many block as you need. To add blocks, click on the toolbox category, and choose your block.
    For now, please take a look at these 2 categories:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Values</b> There are several type of values. The green one is for text, the blue one is for numbers, and the purple one is for list.</li>
    <li><b>Input/Output</b> There are only print and prompt here. If you want Guo to say something, you should use print, while if you want Guo to ask for a value, you can use prompt</li>
</ul>
<p>
    You can combine print-block and any value block to make Guo the-panda say something for you.
    The current block (if you don't modify it yet) will make Guo say <b>...</b>. Since there is a text-value block contains <b>...</b> next to <b>print</b> block
</p>
<p>
    You can use <b>Run</b> button to show the result of your block immediately. 
    You can also see python and javascript code of your block at the bottom of this pane.
</p>
<p>
    Your first task is to make Guo say <b>Hello world</b>. Modify the current block, and click <b>Submit block</b>
