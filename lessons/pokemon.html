    Everyone (both human and pandas) loves pokemon a lot. 
    It is always interesting to have pets you can save in a poke-balls in your pocket.
    Guo loves pokemon too, he want to have his own pokemon.
</p>
<p>
    A newbie pokemon trainer like Guo need to choose his initial pokemon based on his favorite color.
    The pokemon center has already send them a rule to determine anyone's initial pokemon.
    However, Guo's friends doesn't understand the rule. They prefer if there is a program that
    can decide their initial pokemon, and they only need to type their favorite color.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>They who like <b>Red</b> will get <b>Charmender</b></li>
    <li>They who like <b>Green</b> will get <b>Bulbasur</b></li>
    <li>They who like <b>Blue</b> will get <b>Squirtle</b></li>
    <li>They who like <b>Black, White, or any other color</b> will get <b>Snorlax</b></li>
</ul>
<p>
    You see? there are branch here. The output of the program is determined by it's input.
    Help Guo and his friends of Pandaria to overcome the problem.
